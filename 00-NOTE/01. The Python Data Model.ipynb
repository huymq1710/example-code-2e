    "\n",
    "special methods is that they are meant to be called by the Python interpreter, and not by you. You don’t write `my_object.__len__()`. You write len(my_object) and, if my_object is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the `__len__ `method you implemented.\n",

    "\t- the statement for i in x: actually causes the invocation of iter(x), which in turn may call `x.__iter__()` if that is available, or use `x.__getitem__()`\n",
    "\n",
    "--> your code should not have many direct calls to special methods. Unless you are doing a lot of metaprogramming ( vì nó nên được implementing thay vì invoking như hàm `__init__ `) + (invoking nó better to call the related built-in function)\n",

    "- (This means, in simple terms: almost every object you implement should have a functional `__repr__` that’s usable for understanding the object. Implementing `__str__` is optional: do that if you need a “pretty print” functionality (for example, used by a report generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "- (My rule of thumb: `__repr__` is for developers, `__str__` is for customers.)\n",
    "- In short, the goal of `__repr__` is to be unambiguous and `__str__` is to be readable.\n",
